				<div class="header-text headline-text">IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure your ReVanced Manager is using the latest patches version before proceeding</div>
				<div class="border-bottom"></div>
				<div class="header-text headline-text">Getting the APK File</div>
				<ul>
					<li>Go to ReVanced Manager, tap the Patcher tab, then the Select an app, and tap the <code>Suggested: xx.xx.xx</code> box in the app that you want to patch. This should perform a google search for the app name and version, where it should display <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com">APKMirror</a> as the 1st search result <i>(The APK version should match with the suggested one that you saw)</i></li>
					<li>Once you're in the <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com">APKMirror</a> web page, scroll till you find the APK links for YouTube <i>(Don't tap the one that says <code>BUNDLE</code>)</i></li>
					<li>Download the APK file, but DO NOT install it YET. If you do, you will instead try updating the stock unpatched YouTube app which you probably have preinstalled depending on your device</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="header-text headline-text">Now to the patching process</div>
				<ul>
					<li>Go to ReVanced Manager, tap the Patcher tab, then the Select an app, and tap the "Storage" button. Now find the YouTube APK that you just downloaded</li>
					<li>If you want, you can review the patches by tapping the Selected patches section. Changing the patches selection requires enabling <code>Allow changing patch selection</code> at Settings</li>
					<li>Tap the "Patch" button and wait / watch the patching process</li>
					<li>If the patching process is successful, you can now install the patched YouTube app</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="header-text headline-text">Questions and Answers</div>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; I can't download anything from APKMirror</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Find a reputable source for the base APK file, APKPure for example</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; What is the purpose of microG Services and why do I need it as a non-rooted user?</span>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore/releases">microG Services (ReVanced fork)</a> allows you to sign in to apps that have been patched with <code>GmsCore support</code> patch like <strong>YouTube</strong>, YT Music, and Google Photos <i>(Reasons: Package name renaming and to use microG instead of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gms">Google Play Services</a>)</i></li>
					<li>This is a comment from Reddit explaining why it's needed for non-rooted users: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedapp/comments/1bwvwpk/safetynet_is_important_and_if_your_phone_is/ky9nngt/">https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedapp/comments/1bwvwpk/safetynet_is_important_and_if_your_phone_is/ky9nngt/</a></li>
					<li>If you don't have this installed, it will direct you to a GitHub page for ReVanced GmsCore</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; It says "Installation conflict"</span>
				<ul>
					<li>There are multiple possible scenarios with this one:
						<ul class="nested-ul">
							<li>Did you patch YouTube with the <code>Default</code> patches selection? If you accidentally excluded the <code>GmsCore support</code> patch, include it back <i>(this is not needed for rooted users as they use the mounted install)</i></li>
							<li>Did you just recently uninstalled and reinstalled ReVanced Manager? If so, then the keystore being used is now different from the last time the YouTube app was patched & installed <i>(the root problem: signature mismatch)</i></li>
							<li>Did you use the universal <code>Change package name</code> patch? The package name has to be unique and do not rely on the <code>Default</code> preset <i>(example: <code>youtube.revanced.build.compiled.by.jpa102</code>)</i></li>
							<li>Did you patch a version of YouTube that's not in the compatible range? That will cause some, most, or all patches to fail on it</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; Why is my YouTube ReVanced have slightly lower volume than the original one?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Check this GitHub issue about volume levels on different Spoof video streams: <a href="https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/issues/4482">https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/issues/4482</a></li>

				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; I have Family link app installed for my kid's account, and YouTube ReVanced immediately closes</span>

					<li>Either enable the <code>Disable translucent status bar</code>, or include the <code>Set target SDK version 34</code> universal patch</li>

				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; I always see the "This content isn't available" error</span>
				<ul>
					<li>To be fair, I have no exact idea why this phenomenon happens. But from what I can search on Reddit including from r/revancedapp, it could be an account issue</li>
					<li>Some say it's a result from the use of VPN / Proxy, mass downloading content using some app <i>(notably yt-dlp users)</i>, signing in to 3rd party apps that use some form of private api</li>
					<li>I think no one has the definitive solution for this, but here are some support.google.com links:
						<ul class="nested-ul">
							<li><a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/302159411/this-content-isn-t-available">https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/302159411/this-content-isn-t-available</a></li>

						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The safest ways are either wait for like a certain period of time <i>(1 ~ 3 weeks?)</i>, or ask directly in google support to fix your account</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; Why does it display "GmsCore does not have permission to run in the background."?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Depending on your device and the operating system it uses, you will need to allow it to run in the background <i>(there are posts from other people about this, but we can gladly talk about it in my <code>discussions</code> repository)</i></li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; My battery drains fast, and it also overheats for no reason</span>
				<ul>
					<li>There is a GitHub issue talking about this: <a href="https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/issues/5223">https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/issues/5223</a></li>
					<li>Some say it's the device's fault, YouTube's fault, From the android version, and so on. There are some people reporting it's caused by one of the patches</li>
					<li>Until now, this remains a deep mystery as to why it happens</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; I want to use Custom filters to hide certain elements in my YouTube ReVanced</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Go to Settings =&gt; ReVanced =&gt; General =&gt; Custom filter and enable the feature, you will also need to turn on debugging</li>
					<li>To get filters, you will need to use adb to get the <code>pathBuilder</code> / component strings. Run the command <code>logcat | grep LithoFilterPatch</code> inside your terminal running with adb and <a href="https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/issues/6053">find element names that end in either <code>.eml</code>, <code>.e-js-b</code>, or similar</a></li>
					<li>Once found, put it in the custom filters <i>(Example: <code>video_lockup$relatedH</code>)</i></li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; It says "Can't downgrade"</span>
				<ul>
					<li>You have patched an older (but compatible) version of the app and it's trying to install it on top of the greater one <i>(Example: 20.07.39 to 20.14.43)</i></li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; When I update my old YouTube ReVanced build, will my ReVanced preferences stay?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Absolutely yes! But you can back up your preferences at Settings &gt ReVanced &gt Miscelllaneous &gt Import / Export just to be on the safe side</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; I want to create my own app icon and header, how can I do that?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Since I'm no expert at something like Photoshop, there are probably guides out there like in Reddit which you can search <i>(certain patches have instructions that you can follow and give you an idea)</i></li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; I was told to repatch after posting a question to my problem but I still experience it, what can I do?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>You can open a bug report at <a href="https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/issues">https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/issues</a> <i>(if you haven't already)</i></li>
					<li>Or open an issue / discussion at my repository so we can have a nice little chat: <a href="https://github.com/jpa102/revanced-discussions">https://github.com/jpa102/revanced-discussions</a> <i>(i may not be able to see your discussion immediately though as i tend to be offline at some times)</i></li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; I can't successfully patch YouTube using ReVanced Manager on my device, what can I do?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>If you have access to a PC, you can still patch using <a href="https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-cli">revanced-cli</a> [ sample command: <code>java -jar revanced-cli-5.0.1-all.jar patch youtube-20.14.43-apkmirror.apk -p patches-5.46.0.rvp</code> ]. You will need to set up the Java environment first though in order to use it <i>(follow the pc guide in here: <a href="/blog/tutorials/revanced/general-install/">/blog/tutorials/revanced/general-install/</a>)</i></li>
					<li>Or if you have a secondary device or someone else's device that you can borrow, you can try patching from there and export the patched apk to your device afterwards</li>
