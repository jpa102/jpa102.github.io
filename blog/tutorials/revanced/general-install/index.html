				<div class="header-text headline-text">Welcome to the world of ReVanced! Here are the steps for Mobile and PC <i>(guide with images coming soon)</i></div>
				<div class="header-text headline-text">Since this is a general guide for ReVanced, navigate back to see specific guides</i></div>
				<div class="border-bottom"></div>
				<div class="header-text headline-text">Mobile</div>
				<ul>
					<li>Go to <a href="https://revanced.app/download">https://revanced.app/download</a> and tap the download button</li>
					<li>Install the ReVanced Manager APK file <i>(Some Android versions may need additional steps in order to install APKs from unknown sources)</i></li>
					<li>Once done, now you can start patching apps</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="header-text headline-text">The patching process...</div>
				<ul>
					<li>Go to ReVanced Manager, tap the Patcher tab, then the Select an app box <i>(If the app that you want to patch isn't installed, it will show up as package names)</i></li>
					<li>Always patch using APK Files matching the suggested version from your local storage. Patching a Split APK directly from ReVanced Manager <i>(when you tap from the app list)</i> is currently reserved for rooted users, in which you have to use an app called <a href="https://github.com/AbdurazaaqMohammed/AntiSplit-M">Antisplit-M</a> to convert a <code>BUNDLE</code> file into a patchable APK file</li>
					<li>Providing an APK file is as follows: Dashboard =&gt; Patcher tab =&gt; Select an app =&gt; Storage button =&gt; Downloads folder =&gt; appname.apk file</li>
					<li>Tap the "Patch" button and wait / watch the patching process <i>(You can review the patches selection by tapping the Selected patches box, unchecking & checking / patches before patching the app requires enabling <code>Allow changing patch selection</code> at Settings)</i></li>
					<li>If the patching process is successful, you can now install the patched app</li>
					<li>Sharing the patched APK file is easy, just tap the 💾 save icon at the bottom left corner, then save it to a folder and you can now share it to anyone</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="border-bottom"></div>
				<div class="header-text headline-text">PC</div>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-cli/blob/main/docs/0_prerequisites.md">Head to this link</a> and set up the Java Runtime Environment <i>(I personally use the Azul one)</i>. This can vary on different operating systems whether you're using a Windows, Linux, or macOS</li>
					<li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-cli/releases">https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-cli/releases</a> and find the one that doesn't say <code title="this is called the pre-release dev patches, which is used by testers and developers">dev</code> in it <i>(Download the <code>jar</code> file inside Assets)</i></li>
					<li>Now go to <a href="https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/releases">https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/releases</a> and find the one that doesn't say <code title="this is called the pre-release dev patches, which is used by testers and developers">dev</code> in it <i>(Download the <code title="this is revanced's file name extension for 'ReVanced Patches'">rvp</code> file inside Assets)</i></li>
					<li>Place the jar and rvp files in a folder which you can easily access via your terminal <i>(In my case, it's at <code>E:\revanced</code>)</i></li>
					<li>Verify that the Java components work and once done, now you can start patching apps</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="header-text headline-text">The patching process...</div>
				<span class="paragraph-text">NOTE: I have changed the file names to avoid confusion. Tools and patches change their version numbers whenever they get updated</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Source out an APK file that you want to patch like from <a href="https://www.apkmirror.com">APKMirror</a> <i>(Split APKs have to be converted into a proper APK file first)</i>
						<ul class="nested-ul">
							<li>use <a href="https://github.com/AbdurazaaqMohammed/AntiSplit-M">Antisplit-M</a> if you usually do it on mobile then transfer it to your PC</li>
							<li>use a similar tool for PC <i>(more convenient, i guess?)</i></li>
						</ul>
						then place it into your <code>revanced</code> directory
					</li>
					<li>Open up a terminal, then navigate to the directory where your revanced-cli is <i title="this is from windows">(Example: <code>C:\Users\jpa102&gt; E:</code> | <code>E:\&gt;cd revanced</code>)"</i></li>
					<li>To see patches information for an app, run this command: <code title="it's important to read the text file you just generated from this command so you can know exactly what to include and exclude">java -jar revanced-cli.jar list-patches --with-packages --with-versions --with-options patches.rvp > patches_info.txt</code> <i>(command may differ)</i></li>
					<li>For default selection of patches, run this patching command: <code title="add the version numbers in the jar and rvp file names (example: revanced-cli.jar to revanced-cli-5.0.1-all.jar and patches.rvp to patches-5.46.0.rvp)">java -jar revanced-cli.jar patch yourapkfile.apk -p patches.rvp</code></li>
					<li>For custom selection of patches, open up a text editor, craft your command, and run it like this: <code title="refer to your dumped patches info txt file for more information">java -jar revanced-cli.jar patch yourapkfile.apk -e "a patch" --ei=0 -O=patchOption=Value -d "a patch" --di=1 -o "appname-patched.apk" -p patches.rvp</code>, where:
						<ul class="nested-ul">
							<li><code>-e</code> - the exact patch name, means include</li>
							<li><code>--ei</code> - the patch based on its index number, means include</li>
							<li><code>-d</code> - the exact patch name, means exclude</li>
							<li><code>--di</code> - the patch based on its index number, means exclude</li>
							<li><code>-O=patchOption=</code> - the patch option name, a = sign at the end is the value</li>
							<li><code>-o</code> - set a custom apk filename output</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>If the patching process is successful, you can now install the patched app. Choose between 2 methods:
						<ul class="nested-ul">
							<li>connecting your device with <code title="you can enable this in developer options">USB Debugging</code> enabled, then run this command: <code title="if the apk filename is too long, you can type in the few words then press the tab key to autofill it. the patched apk file should end with the -patched prefix">java -jar revanced-cli.jar utility install --apk=yourapkfile-patched.apk</code></li>
							<li>transfer the patched apk file to your phone's storage and manually install the apk from there</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="header-text headline-text">Questions and Answers</div>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; Are there any apps that I can patch with ReVanced?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>See the comprehensive list at <a href="https://revanced.app/patches">https://revanced.app/patches</a></li>
					<li>You can research them by tapping the package names at the sidebar, then tap the package name besides the version numbers to redirect you to Google Play Store)</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; I saw in ReVanced Manager settings that there's "Show universal patches", should I enable it?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>You can enable it, but there's no guarantee that all apps can be patched and will work with them. It will however depend from app to app and may have different side effects</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; I saw at <a href="https://revanced.app/patches">https://revanced.app/patches</a> that there's lots of compatible app versions outside of the suggested version, but it's preventing me from patching them</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Disable the <code>Require suggested app version</code> and <code>Version compatibility check</code> in ReVanced Manager settings</li>
					<li>But take note: The patching process may produce different results, such as a certain patch failing for that version</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; I can't find any APK files for the app I want to patch</span>
				<ul>
					<li>If for example is only available on let's say Google Play Store, download it from there, then extract it into a patchable APK file using <a href="https://github.com/AbdurazaaqMohammed/AntiSplit-M">Antisplit-M</a></li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; Why do I have to provide an APK file from storage when I can just select it from the app list instead?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>The thing is, some apps are installed as Split APKs. If your device is not rooted, you will have to provide an APK file from storage</li>
					<li>Even if you can, the version installed may not be patchable at all</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; Why does it say that I have to disable auto updates?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Most apps are still recognizable from Google Play Store and can show that there's updates available for them, so it's best that you disable its auto-update functionality from Settings inside Google Play Store</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; It says "Installation conflict"</span>
				<ul>
					<li>There are multiple possible scenarios with this one:
						<ul class="nested-ul">
							<li>Did you just recently uninstalled and reinstalled / cleared the app data of ReVanced Manager? If so, then the keystore being used is now different from the last time the app was patched & installed <i>(The root problem: Signature mismatch)</i></li>
							<li>Did you use the universal <code>Change package name</code> patch? The package name has to be unique and do not rely on the <code>Default</code> preset <i>(Example: <code>app.patched.with.revanced.by.jpa102</code>)</i></li>
							<li>Some apps have this thing called "Shared permissions", which if one app has a different signature but shares the same permission as the other app, it will throw an error called <code>INSTALL_FAILED_DUPLICATE_PERMISSION</code> <i>(there are 2 settings inside the <code>Change package name</code> patch which you can try and use, <a href="">this is not the case with meta apps though</a>)</i></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; It says "Can't downgrade"</span>
				<ul>
					<li>You have patched an older (but compatible) version of the app and it's trying to install it on top of the greater one <i>(Example: 20.07.39 to 20.14.43)</i></li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; It says "Installation incompatible"</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Check your device's architecture at ReVanced Manager's About section, you should see the <code>Supported Archs</code>. Then patch an apk that corresponds to your device's architecture</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; Why does the patching process immediately fail after pressing the Patch button?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>There are multiple possible scenarios with this one:
						<ul class="nested-ul">
							<li>Your device has ran out of available RAM, if you're seeing the <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> text</li>
							<li>Your device is running low on internal storage, give it at least 5gb of free space</li>
							<li>In rare cases, the app is not fully decompilable</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>You can try decreasing the amount of included patches and try patching again</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; Why does it say that I have no root access when i try to install the patched app?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>If you have a device like Xiaomi (or any MIUI based device), temporarily disable its MIUI optimization from developer options</li>
					<li>source: <a href="https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-manager/issues/1609#issuecomment-2191138515">https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-manager/issues/1609#issuecomment-2191138515</a></li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; My ReVanced Manager says that it has 0.0.0 patches version</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Try these options:
						<ul class="nested-ul">
							<li>Clear ReVanced Manager's app cache and force stopping it</li>
							<li>Disable and reenable the <code>Auto update patches</code></li>
							<li>Check your Internet connection config, it may be that you're using a DNS / VPN / something that blocks certain domains</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>This is also applicable if the patches version won't change</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; Why does my patched app still have errors even though I believe it's already patched to the latest version?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>Do you use alternative patch sources? If so, then it's following the patches version that the author provides and not from the official ReVanced team. Disable the <code>Use alternative sources</code> for now and restart the manager</li>
					<li>If you're indeed using the original patches source for ReVanced Manager, you can create a bug report at their GitHhub repository</li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; Why I can't patch an app with any Universal patches?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>It may be the <code>androlib</code> issue that's present on apps like Facebook: <a href="https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/issues/?q=is%3Aissue%20androlib">https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/issues/?q=is%3Aissue%20androlib</a></li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; I was told to repatch after posting a question to my problem but I still experience it, what can I do?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>You can open a bug report at <a href="https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/issues">https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches/issues</a> <i>(if you haven't already)</i></li>
					<li>Or open an issue / discussion at my repository so we can have a nice little chat: <a href="https://github.com/jpa102/revanced-discussions">https://github.com/jpa102/revanced-discussions</a> <i>(i may not be able to see your discussion immediately though as i tend to be offline at some times)</i></li>
				</ul>
				<span class="paragraph-text">&gt; I can't successfully patch using ReVanced Manager on my device, but I don't have a PC. So what can I do?</span>
				<ul>
					<li>You have 2 options:
						<ul class="nested-ul">
							<li>if you have a secondary device or someone else's device that you can borrow, you can try patching from there and export the patched apk to your device afterwards</li>
							<li>trust a internet stranger like me to give you a patched apk with options that you want</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
